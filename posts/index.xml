      <description>ClickHouse doesn&amp;rsquo;t have window functions, but there is a workaround, arrays, which allow you to process chunks of data lying in the same structure, just like you do in Python with list. In this article I want to tell you about a couple of useful applications of the range() function, which can generate a sequence of integers in an array. And the arrayJoin function knows how to expand data from an array into a column, that&amp;rsquo;s the story around which this article will be arrayJoin(range())</description>
